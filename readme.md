#Random Loop 🔁

When you wanna train for many things is very useful to have a looper, but this time I needed a looper that gave me a random word for each loop in that is what this is about.

You will have as an input

- Amount of intervals you want
- The duration for each interval
- The words you want

All the words will be looped if there are enough intervals, and the words will be saved in the local storage in order to keep the words for future times you visist the web.

For sure doing projects to solve problems you have is very satisfying :)
